    <h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
    <br>
            <p>Forming in 1965, The Grateful Dead performed over 2,300 live performances in their career.</p>
			      <p>The band originally formed in Palo Alto, California in 1965. When they first started playing they went under the name The Warlocks.</p>
            <p>They played their first show as The Grateful Dead in San Jose, California in December 1965.</p>
			      <p>The band had a loyal group of people that would follow them from show to show trying to gain access</p>
            <p>any way that they could. Since Grateful Dead fans would follow the band for many months at a time </p>
            <p>a lot of people would sell things in the parking lot before the show would start.</p>
			      <p>Some of the things that would be for sale are things like food, shirts, art, and other more hidden dealings.</p>
            <p>The band was known for their long improvisation pieces that would take place at every show</p>
            <p>Even though many of the band members wrote numerous top hits the band had, one of their top lyricist was a man that wasn't even a formal member.</p>
            <p>Robert Hunter did perform with the band in September 1967, even though it was only for four gigs his lyrics are what made him a special</p>
            <p>part of the band</p>
